Disclaimer: This is a demo, not production ready code.

## Licensing

Anvil is licensed LGPLv2.1 and to the extent I own the copyright on the code in this repo you are free to use it under that, or the MIT or Apache2 licenses.

The `stl` module in this repo is largely not my own work but copied from [bevy_stl]( https://github.com/nilclass/bevy_stl/blob/main/src/lib.rs) and released under a MIT licensed by Niklas Cathor, the MIT license is embedded in the file. Of course all bugs are my own and should be reported here, not there.

`examples/editor.rs` contains example code copied from Anvil to make a lego brick, and as such can probably only be used under the LGPLv2.1 license.
